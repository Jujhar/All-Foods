    <p>Modern genetic studies have identified the center of origin of coconuts
    as being the Central Indo-Pacific, the region between western Southeast
    Asia and Melanesia, where it shows greatest genetic diversity</p>

    <p>They need year round warmth and moisture to grow well and fruit.
    Coconut palms are hard to establish in dry climates, and cannot grow there
    without frequent irrigation; in drought conditions.</p>
